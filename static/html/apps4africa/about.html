	<h4>About Apps4Africa</h4>
    <p>Apps4Africa is a unique acceleration program designed to discover, fund, and help scale Africa's brightest startup companies and social enterprises. We work with both for-profit companies as well as non-profits and offer $10,000 in funding under favorable terms. Our program is Pan-African, servicing innovators from across the African continent.</p>
	<p>Established in 2009 by <a href="http://appfrica.com">Appfrica</a>, we're one of Africa's oldest acceleration programs for entrepreneurs.</p>

	<h4>How We're Doing</h4>	
	<p>To date we've accepted 19 companies into the accelerator, from 12 countries, of which 11 are still active. While our own contributions are small, we've been able to help companies raise (on average) over $90,000 in follow-on funding per company for a total of nearly $1 million raised. Often either we or our partners play a direct role in helping our participants get additional funding, other times its through their own hard-work and hustle. One thing remains constant, we're always thrilled to play a small part in their progress.</p>
