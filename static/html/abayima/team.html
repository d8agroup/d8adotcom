						<p>In 2009 Jon spoke at TED in Oxford, UK about is work connecting rural African villages to the internet through a call center and light infrastructure. The service, in collaboration with non-profit OpenMind, was called QuestionBox and allowed rural Africans with no access to the internet to ask questions and get timely, vetted answers to everyday questions.</p>
