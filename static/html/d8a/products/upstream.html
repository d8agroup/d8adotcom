        <p>Upstream is a technology-driven platform for gathering business and humanitarian intelligence in frontier markets by aggregating and parsing information on web, mobile and social media channels. Visit <a href="http://upstream-analytics.com">Upstream-Analytics.com</a></p>
		<p>The absence of data and analytics on frontier market operating environments exposes companies to regulatory and reputation risks. New regulations introduced in 2014 governing “conflict minerals” (DF-1502) requires all publicly listed companies to identify whether they are contributing to conflict in Africa. No cost effective method of compliance currently exists.</p>
		<p>An estimated 6000 public listed companies are expected to spend $8 billion in complying with DF-1502. Ongoing annual compliance costs for additional regulatory measures - including FCPA, UK Bribery Act and OECD doing business guidelines - as well as annual costs related to ensuring reputational integrity in frontier markets, are estimated to be much greater.</p>
		<p>Upstream applies mobile crowdsourcing, advanced data and statistical analysis, and visualization to identify, assess and mitigate companies' risks in frontier markets. The initial focus will be on helping companies comply with DF-1502, but we intend to expand the platform to address reputation risks to their brands and/or shareholders, including major institutional investors.
