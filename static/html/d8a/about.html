					<p>D8A Group (a.k.a 'the data group') builds dashboards that make it easy to surface trends and predictive patterns in public safety, municipal services, and finance to help officials make better decisions. We use maps, social media streams, news feeds, and demography data to tell the story of cities.</p>
					<p>Our products transform different public data streams into actionable insights which can be paired with existing business data. This allows our clients in public safety, crime prevention, and finance to make more informed, decisions.</p>
					<p>Our suite of predictive analytic SaaS products let users see patterns in behavior. D8A's proprietary algorithms instantly scan hundreds of millions of online conversation and activities to provide the earliest alerts about what's happening <em>(and what may happen soon)</em>. This helps users anticipate where, when, and what people need in real-time.</p>
