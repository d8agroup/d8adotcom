        <p>Working with the acclaimed photographer and data enthusiast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Smolan" target="_blank">Rick Smolan</a>, D8A created a data visualization application that was designed to explore over three million global responses to a <a href="http://thehumanfaceofbigdata.com/" target="_blank">Human Face of Big Data</a> survey.</p>
        <p>The data discovery application D8A built was used in global showcase events in Singapore, London and New York by journalists and project sponsors to explore the results of this groundbreaking lifestyle survey. The project - sponsored by <a href="http://www.emc.com/index.htm?fromGlobalSiteSelect" target="_blank">EMC</a> - has continued to gain recognition and acclaim and our contribution was called out by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/02/human-face-of-big-data-smartphone-app-launch" target="_blank">the Guardian</a> shortly after the event (Note this project was carried out under our MetaLayer brand).</p>

            <p>We were able to work with the client to reimagine the way that people interact with data. We created dynamic and interactive visualizations that allowed users to easily explore the insights and findings.</p>
