        <p>Working with the acclaimed photographer and data enthusiast <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Smolan" target="_blank">Rick Smolan</a> and EMC, D8A helped to launch THE HUMAN FACE OF BIG DATA book tour. D8A created data visualization applications  designed to explore over three million global responses to a survey.</p>
        <p>The data discovery application D8A built was used in global showcase events in Singapore, London, and New York by journalists and project sponsors to explore the results of this groundbreaking lifestyle survey. The project - sponsored by <a href="http://www.emc.com/index.htm?fromGlobalSiteSelect" target="_blank">EMC</a> - has continued to gain recognition and acclaim and our contribution was called out by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/02/human-face-of-big-data-smartphone-app-launch" target="_blank">the Guardian</a> shortly after the event (Note this project was carried out under our MetaLayer brand).</p>
