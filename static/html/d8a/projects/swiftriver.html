        <p>Prior to founding members of D8A staff were involved in the development of a number of popular open source platforms used for crowdsourcing at Ushahidi. Since then, our team has diligently worked to understand problems faced by emergency responders and delivered solutions. We've deployed Ushahidi and SwiftRiver technologies to help our customers sift only the most relevant information from the crowd, to help them with disaster response and humanitarian efforts.</p>
