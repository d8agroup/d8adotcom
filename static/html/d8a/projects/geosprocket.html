        <p>Working with our friends at <a href="http://www.geosprocket.com/" target="_blank">GEOSPROCKET</a> we created a data platform that automatically extracted meta data from social media messages in order to visualize various values.</p>
        <p>Looking for location data in tweets is a topic of heavy research and at D8A, we were able to add real value to the datasets that GeoSprocket were looking to map by leveraging our data processing technologies to extract and geo-locate place names mentioned in the tweets. The end result was a fully interactive map visualization of all tweets mentioning the effects of hurricanes on the Northeastern coast of the USA.</p>

            <p>The data processing platform that we deployed as part of this project was capable of geo-locating over 1,000 unique items of content per minute and built on our knowledge of the excellent open source natural language processing engine <a href="http://nltk.org/" target="_blank">NLTK</a> </p>
