        <p>Working with our friends at <a href="http://www.geosprocket.com/" target="_blank">GEOSPROCKET</a> D8A's products were used to support research that helped direct first-responders during a hurricane.</p>
        <p>By surfacing the metadata buried within gigs of Twitter streams, their team was able to find relationships between social media activity and what was occurring offline. It's this power to surface correlations that makes our products invaluable to those working in Public Safety.</p>
