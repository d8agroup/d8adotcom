         <h4>Frontier Market Regulations</h4><br/>
        <p>The absence of data on frontier market operating environments exposes companies to regulatory and reputation risks. New regulations introduced in 2014 governing “conflict minerals” (DF1502) requires all publicly listed companies to identify whether they are contributing to conflict in Africa.</p>

        <h4>Better Decisions Through Data</h4><br/>
        <p>Annual compliance costs for regulatory measures (including DF-1502, FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and OECD Doing Business Guidelines) for companies working in frontier markets can be in the millions per company. Upstream reduces these costs exponentially.</p>
